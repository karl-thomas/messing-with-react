## Personal Website
Hello! This is my personal website. You can see the current build over at [karl-thomas.com](http://karl-thomas.com). I am also serving my [automatic-blog api](https://github.com/karl-thomas/automatic-blog) to this site. It is a work in progress so feel free to watch it. 

This is a React.js app built with Webpack and Node.js.
## Contributing
Please make PRs and issues if something is horrendously wrong, you find a typo, or something inbetween.
